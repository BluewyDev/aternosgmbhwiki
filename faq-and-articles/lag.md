# Lag

If you are experiencing lag, the first suggestion we make would be to check out the official article created by aternos in their support center \([https://support.aternos.org/hc/en-us/articles/360027350792-Lags](https://support.aternos.org/hc/en-us/articles/360027350792-Lags)\). 

If your server software is Spigot/Bukkit or Vanilla, we recommend you to use the Paper/Bukkit software. This software is better for optimization and performance as it's been designed specifically to optimize your gameplay on servers. IF you intend to switch, we recommend you to make a backup before switching between softwares. If you use Paper/Bukkit or Spigot/Bukkit, you can also follow this article: [https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/guide-server-optimization%E2%9A%A1.283181/](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/guide-server-optimization%E2%9A%A1.283181/)

If your server software is Fabric or Forge, you can use some mods such as Lithium, Phosphor, Sodium, optifine etc. for better optimization. Some mods have to be installed only on your server, and not the client. And others only on your client and not the server, make sure to check this. 

If your server software is bedrock or is a modpack, there's not much you can do against lag, or to lessen it even a little bit. Modpacks tend to be heavy and can cause much lag, and with the RAM Aternos can provide, you won't always have perfectly running modpacks, and the host can not just simply fix this by "installing", or "buying" more RAM.
