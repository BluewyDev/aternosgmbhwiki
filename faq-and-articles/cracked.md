# Cracked

If you got issues connecting with your server due to "invalid session", "unable to verify username" or certain other errors, you should check these articles out as this page is not to get help with cracked for: [https://support.aternos.org/hc/en-us/articles/360027235691-Allow-cracked-players-to-join](https://support.aternos.org/hc/en-us/articles/360027235691-Allow-cracked-players-to-join) \|\| [https://support.exaroton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011116177-Invalid-Session-Invalid-Token-Failed-to-verify-username](https://support.exaroton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011116177-Invalid-Session-Invalid-Token-Failed-to-verify-username)

It's common for people to be using cracked launchers as they can not afford the actual game. However, this is illegal and not recommended at all. First of all, many people think that simply because of the online-mode option being there, cracked is totally legal and allowed, **this statement is false**. The online-mode option was there so you could play offline, easing gameplay with bad internet. Although this can be used for cracked accounts as this option does not use the mojang authentication servers, it's not what it was for.

Another common misconception is that launchers such as "tlauncher" are legal:

As you can see in the above screenshot, it says "Do not redistribute our games or any alterations of our games or game files." This is basically what tlauncher, and so many other non-official launchers are doing without their legal permission, making it illegal. 

No, it is unlikely the police, FBI, NSA, CIA, or the army will storm into your house and throw you into jail for a life long time. But that does not make this any less illegal. Our suggestion?

Stop using cracked/illegal launchers and use the official one. If you can not afford it, you should try asking your parents to buy Minecraft for you as a christmas, or birthday present. If this doesn't work and you simply can't afford it, wait till you can.
