# Cracked

If you got issues connecting with your server due to "invalid session", "unable to verify username" or certain other errors, you should check these articles out as this page is not to get help with cracked for: [https://support.aternos.org/hc/en-us/articles/360027235691-Allow-cracked-players-to-join](https://support.aternos.org/hc/en-us/articles/360027235691-Allow-cracked-players-to-join) \|\| [https://support.exaroton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011116177-Invalid-Session-Invalid-Token-Failed-to-verify-username](https://support.exaroton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011116177-Invalid-Session-Invalid-Token-Failed-to-verify-username)

It's common for people to be using cracked launchers as they can not afford the actual game. However, this is illegal and not recommended at all. First of all, many people think that simply because of the online-mode option being there, cracked is totally legal and allowed, **this statement is false**. The online-mode option was there so you could play offline, easing gameplay with bad internet. Although this can be used for cracked accounts as this option does not use the mojang authentication servers, it's not what it was for.

Another common misconception is that launchers such as "tlauncher" are legal:

As you can see in the above screenshot, it says "Do not redistribute our games or any alterations of our games or game files." This is basically what tlauncher, and so many other non-official launchers are doing without their legal permission, making it illegal. 

No, it is unlikely the police, FBI, NSA, CIA, or the army will storm into your house and throw you into jail for a life long time. But that does not make this any less illegal. Our suggestion?

Stop using cracked/illegal launchers and use the official one. If you can not afford it, you should try asking your parents to buy Minecraft for you as a christmas, or birthday present. If this doesn't work and you simply can't afford it, wait till you can.

## Hacking cracked servers

People often come into the discord server or forums and say their servers were hacked. However, these are just as often cracked servers. Cracked servers often get "hacked" through players suddenly gaining OP. **Cracked servers do not actually get "hacked".** Cracked servers also have more security risks, one of these being the possibility that anyone can log in using _**any**_ name, and the playerdata bound to that name would be given to anyone using that specific name, making it really easy to get OP that way. **Always make sure to use login security plugins like AuthMe Reloaded and/or to use the whitelist. \(Reminder that the whitelist may not always work as people can use this same loophole to cheat the whitelist.\)** 

Other servers that are not cracked have barely any chance of getting hacked, as the only form for that would be using hack clients like wurst or aristois which can be countered using anticheat plugins, or simply getting staff.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You are in control of your own server, and we do not ban or limit players on your server in any way. To prohibit unwanted players from joining, enable the whitelist in the options, and add allowed players to the whitelist on the Players page. If you have activated cracked in the options, you should install an authentication plugin like Authme or LoginSecurity.
